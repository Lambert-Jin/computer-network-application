Messenger and WhatsApp are widely used as a method for large groups of people to have
conversations online. In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to implement your own version
of a messaging and video talk application. Your application is based on a client-server model consisting
of one server and multiple clients communicating concurrently. The text messages should be
communicated using TCP for the reason of reliability, while the video (we will use video files instead
of capturing the live video streams from cameras and microphones) should be communicated using UDP
for the reason of low latency. Your application will support a range of functions that are typically found
on messaging apps including authentication, message one participant (i.e., private chat), build the group
chat for part of the participants, and uploading video streams (i.e., files in this assignment). You will be
designing custom application protocols based on TCP and UDP.
